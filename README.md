## 📖 About the Project

This is a task management web application built as part of the *ASP.NET Fundamentals* course of SoftUni. It demonstrates core concepts like MVC architecture, Entity Framework Core, and RESTful API design.


## ⚙️ What tasks we manage?

The application helps drivers find a parking spot with ease while giving property owners an accessible way to earn extra cash. It matches a driver’s location or destination with nearby available parking spots and handles everything from fee management to automated billing, providing a one-click revenue report to owners. It’s designed to also be suitable to private driveway owners who can now rent out their space 24/7, whether they’re at work, traveling, or just out shopping.

}
```

To create and seed the database:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Staging
dotnet ef database update
```
